#### CODEBOOK

##### Important note on UNITS:
As described in the original "README.txt" file (provided in the "Original Content" directory):

    Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Hence, since we're dealing with *normalized* features, the values expressed are **unitless**.


"subject"
    --> 30 subjects in total, numbered accordingly [1,2,...,30]

"activity"
    --> one of 6 possible types of activity: walking (regular), 
            walking upstairs, walking downstairs, lying down,
            standing, & sitting.
