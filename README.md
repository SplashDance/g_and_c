### This is the README.md file, set up to explain how all of the scripts work and are connected.

* The file "run_analysis" includes the relevant code for "tidying" the data. [Note: as per the instructions, the script assumes that the data set is already in the current working directory when run. Nevertheless, the dataset can be obtained via [this link][id]]
* The folder: "Original Content" provides the original descriptions from the UCI HAR Dataset



##### Elements of a *tidy data set*
The script I've provided ensures that:

1. Each variable measured is in its own column
2. Different observations of that a given variable are all in a different rows.
3. One table for each “kind” of variable [Note: this element of "tidy data" does not pertain to this script, however]
4. With multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked.
